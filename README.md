Ever wanted a checklist that appears right on your character screen and automatically marks off your progress? No need for extra addons, spreadsheets, or task lists for each character? Then this is for you! Master Collector introduces the world's first mount tracker checklist for daily & weekly things to do!

Key Features:

*   **NEW**! Daily & Weekly Timer till reset at the top of relevant tabs to keep track of when everything resets!

*   **NEW!** Existing modules are now tracking most mounts up to **AND** including Shadowlands content!
    *   Some Dragonflight content has been included, with Renown Tracking not showing mounts just yet.

*   **NEW! SHADOWLANDS** **CROSS COVENANT TRACKING!**
    *   If opting for Shadowlands Covenants to be shown in Filters, you can keep track of your current covenant level in all 4 covenants simulatenously. On first use, you will need to switch to all 4 different covenants for the addon to store the data and away you go! One of the first addons that can do this!
